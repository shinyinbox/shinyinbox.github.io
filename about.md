Iâ€™m not a programmer, but wanted to share the simple productivity hacks I find useful. I mostly use Mac and iOS.

Software I use: 

* [Keyboard Maestro](http://keyboardmaestro.com): most of my hacks are based on this because it's so versatile.
* [BetterTouchTool](http://www.boastr.net): for window management gestures.
* [LaunchBar](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html): for launching apps, web searches, calculator, some quick file managements, and miscellaneous tasks. Also a fan of [Alfred.](http://www.alfredapp.com)
* [ClipMenu](http://www.clipmenu.com): for clipboard management.
* [nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/): For the Mac side of Dropbox-synced notes.
* [Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/): For the iOS side of Dropbox-synced notes. I've also liked using [Byword](http://bywordapp.com) and [Notesy](http://notesy-app.com).
* [Drafts](http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/): enables so much on iOS.
