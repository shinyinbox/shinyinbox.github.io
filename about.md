Iâ€™m a non-programmer grad student, and made this site to share the simple productivity hacks I find useful, mostly on Mac and iOS.

#### Software I use: 

* [Keyboard Maestro](http://keyboardmaestro.com): most of my hacks are based on this because it's so versatile.
* [BetterTouchTool](http://www.boastr.net): for window management gestures.
* [LaunchBar](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html): for launching apps, web searches, calculator, some quick file managements, and miscellaneous tasks. Also a fan of [Alfred.](http://www.alfredapp.com)
* [ClipMenu](http://www.clipmenu.com): for clipboard history viewing.
* [PopClip](http://pilotmoon.com/popclip/): for efficiently taking action on selected text (copy, search google, visit link, etc.)
* [nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/): For the Mac side of Dropbox-synced notes.
* [Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/): For the iOS side of Dropbox-synced notes. I've also liked using [Byword](http://bywordapp.com) and [Notesy](http://notesy-app.com).
* [Drafts](http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/): enables so much on iOS.
* [OmniDiskSweeper](http://www.omnigroup.com/more): for exploring what's taking up space on my drive. It's super simple, but I find it more readable than the more popular [DaisyDisk](http://www.daisydiskapp.com).
* [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword): for keeping my stuff safe online. I use unique, randomly generated 30-character passwords, for pretty much everything.

#### For getting work done, I use:

* [Pages](https://www.apple.com/mac/pages/) and [Numbers](https://www.apple.com/mac/numbers/)
* [Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php): for larger writing projects.
* [DEVONthink Pro](http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/devonthink-pro.html): for organizing and searching reference materials.
* [OmniOutliner](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner): for outlining.
* [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus): for [GTD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done).
* [Scapple](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scapple.php): for diagramming complex concepts.
* [Soulver](http://www.acqualia.com/soulver/): for the occasional document with numbers in it.
* [Anki](http://ankisrs.net): for flashcards.

#### Backup setup:

* [Arq](http://www.haystacksoftware.com/arq/): for **hourly** versioned backups of select folders to Google Drive. Google has both cheap and free plans, which takes a lot of the uncertainty out of the S3 backup option. Plus, the backups are encrypted, so even if someone gained access to 
* [Time Machine](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1427): for **weekly** versioned backups of my entire drive. I like that that the menubar icon reminds me every to backup after 10 days.
* [Amazon Glacier](http://aws.amazon.com/glacier/): for **annual** backups of my most important files from that year, including photos and documents that I want to keep forever. I upload in January. I never plan on downloading these backups, as I have multiple local backups, but it's a really inexpensive safety net. I have about 60 gigbabytes backed up there, which currently costs $0.60 per month.
* [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com): for all the amazing things Dropbox does, in addition to serving as a redundant backup.
