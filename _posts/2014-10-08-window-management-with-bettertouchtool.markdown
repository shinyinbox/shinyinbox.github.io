I previously used [Moom](http://manytricks.com/moom/) for window management. As a fan of the two-pane layout, `Control + Option + Command + Arrow Key` moved a window left or right, with the up arrow maximizing, and the down arrow hiding the window.

What I find even more efficient is the equivalent four-finger swipe gestures in [BetterTouchTool](http://www.boastr.net), which feels like you're physically throwing the windows and quickly becomes second nature. Swipe to the left or right to move the window to the left or right pane. Swipe up to maximize and down to hide the app.

The only exception to this behavior is in the Finder, where I rarely need to maximize a window. I set up app-specific gestures in BetterTouchTool to override the up/down gestures, with `up` triggering `Command-N` to create a new window and `down` triggering `Command-W` to close a window. This also avoids an annoying behavior in OS X, where the Finder cannot be hidden if it is the only non-hidden app.
