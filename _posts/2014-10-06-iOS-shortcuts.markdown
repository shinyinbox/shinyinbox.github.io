You can speed up your typing on iOS by setting up keyboard shortcuts (found in Settings → General → Keyboards → Shortcuts). I've long used the "@@" shortcut to quickly expand my email address, but [Rocket Ink improved](http://rocketink.net/2014/09/ios-@@-shortcut.html) upon this by adding an additional @ for multiple email addresses. In iOS 8, shortcuts are shown in the QuickType bar before they expand, and I've started using them a lot more. For my most common words, I use double letters, such as "tt" for "Thanks!" This works for emoji too, and is a lot faster than switching to another keyboard.
