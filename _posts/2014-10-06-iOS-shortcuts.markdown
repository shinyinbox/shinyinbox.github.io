Speed up typing on iOS with keyboard shortcuts **(Settings → General → Keyboards → Shortcuts)**. In iOS 8, the QuickType bar shows shortcuts before they expand, and I've started using them a lot more. Some of my favorites:

* [The @@ shortcut](http://rocketink.net/2014/09/ios-@@-shortcut.html) for my email addresses.
* Double letters for my most common words: "tt" for "Thanks!"
* Emoji shortcuts are a lot faster than switching to another keyboard.
